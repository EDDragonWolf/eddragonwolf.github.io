  Abstract                 = {The Self-Quotient Image (SQI) Method [Wang H, Li SZ, Wang Y, et al. Self quotient image for face recognition. International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP’04); 2004;Vol. 2. p. 1397–1400; Wang H, Li SZ, Wang Y. Generalized quotient image. IEEE CVPR; 2004; Vol. 2. p. 498–505] is a simple method for lighting normalization based on the Quotient Image method [Shashua A, Riklin-Raviv T. The quotient image: class-based re-rendering and recognition with varying illuminations. T Pattern Anal Mach Intel. 2001;23(2):129–139; Riklin-Raviv T, Shashua A. The quotient image: class based recognition and synthesis under varying illumination. Proceedings of the 1999 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; 1999; Fort Collins (CO). p. 566–571]. The main advantage of the SQI is the use of only one image for lighting normalization. Nevertheless, the SQI still has few disadvantages which make hard to use it in some face recognition systems. In this paper, we introduce the modified version of the SQI method based on globally modified Gaussian filter kernel. In this modification, we tried to solve the disadvantages of the original SQI method, simplify the computational process, and increase the quality of illumination normalization. We have investigated two modification of the original SQI method and shown how they normalize different shadow regions.},
