  Abstract                 = {A new method for upsampling of bitmap images based on randomized interpolation is described. A problem of aliasing, visibility of digital artifacts and accuracy of image analysis is discussed from the viewpoint of the nature of quantization error. A possibility of obtaining a noise-like residual error and attenuation of regular artifacts by the method proposed is demonstrated.},
