  Abstract                 = {The paper deals with the spectrum transformation of the signal restored by regular and irregular sampling. Irregular sampling is studied as a method of obtaining the noise-like error spectrum of the error of a restored signal. Hence the order of the output low-pass filter can be reduced, or in certain cases, this filter can be omitted. The most interesting area of application for this method may be the reproduction of a digital bitmap image. To simplify the problem, the error spectrum transformation is studied for the one-dimension sampling case.},
